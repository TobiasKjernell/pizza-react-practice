trying another type of file-structure. keeping files relevant to folders.
trying out the new routing system from react-router-dom. (createBrowserRouter).

to fetch in router when you going to that page you need the 3 steps:
1. use the 'loader' attribute in route.
2. in your component that going to use the fetch. make a function with fetching ability and return the result.
3. in your component, use a custom hook called 'useLoaderData()' which is provided by react-router-dom. 'const menu = useLoaderData();'

----

loader spinner: in appLayout.jsx we can use something called 'useNavigation'-custom hook. (provided by react-router).
it checks the current state of the page. So when we fetch it still loading the page etc: we click on a page link, it fetch and 
current state will be in 'loading', when it's done loading => turns to 'idle'.
Here we can render a spinner loader or any kind of visual loader.
