trying another type of file-structure. keeping files relevant to folders.
trying out the new routing system from react-router-dom. (createBrowserRouter).

to fetch in router when you going to that page you need the 3 steps:
1. use the 'loader' attribute in route.
2. in your component that going to use the fetch. make a function with fetching ability and return the result.
3. in your component, use a custom hook called 'useLoaderData()' which is provided by react-router-dom. 'const menu = useLoaderData();'

----

loader spinner: in appLayout.jsx we can use something called 'useNavigation'-custom hook. (provided by react-router).
it checks the current state of the page. So when we fetch it still loading the page etc: we click on a page link, it fetch and 
current state will be in 'loading', when it's done loading => turns to 'idle'.
Here we can render a spinner loader or any kind of visual loader.

---- Error handling in routes:

in your parent router, use the attribute: 'errorElement: <component />'.
In your 'error'-component, use the customHook useRouteError() provdied by lib.
useRouterError() receives a object with: data, error[message, stack], internalBool, status: 404/xxx, statusText: string.

You can also put it inside the route with a 'loader' fetching if you want to keep it
in it's own layout.

--- Params

Getting params from 'loader'.
React Route provides a object within the loader(params).
etc: orderLoader({params})..
very similiar to nextj.

--- Writing data / post from router

<Form /> provided by react has alot done for us. We use the attribute 'method' POST/PATCH/DELETE.
In our route for this page there's a route attribute called: 'action'.
This attribute listens on any submit and execute it's delegated function.
In this delegated 'action', usually a async method. It provides some deconstructed variables we can use,
in this case we use 'request'. 
By using 'request.formData()' and then 'Object.fromEntries(formData)', we get make all the information into a object.
We create a new object using existing data, overrite the variable we have to put new information in. 
We can also return a 'redirect' from react routers when done.
